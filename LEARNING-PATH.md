## Custom Path: Design Your Own

### Steps to Create Custom Path

1. **Assess Current Level**
   - Use `/roadmap [specialization]` to understand requirements
   - Identify skill gaps honestly

2. **Set Timeline**
   - Beginner → Intermediate: 3-6 months
   - Intermediate → Advanced: 3-6 months
   - Advanced → Mastery: 6-12 months

3. **Choose Learning Pace**
   - 10 hrs/week: Slow (working professionals)
   - 15-20 hrs/week: Moderate (students)
   - 25+ hrs/week: Fast (intensive)

4. **Create with `/learn` Command**
   ```bash
   /learn [specialization] --level [level] --pace [pace]
   ```

5. **Track with `/progress` Command**
   ```bash
   /progress [specialization] --period weekly
   ```
